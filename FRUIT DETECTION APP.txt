                                                                     FRUIT DETECTION APP


 We want to create an app for fruit detection by using flutter for android and ios and use Flask for website creation for this app.
This system collects images from the camera and has a stored database consisting of thousands of fruits, both rotten or fresh.
Then image processing is done to get the required features of fruit the such as color and size. Defected fruit is detected based on image pixels. 
Sorting is done based on color and size.
The objective of the Fruit detection app using image processing is to design an incremental model to recognize the fruits based on the fruit's size,
shape, and color, ignoring external features like environment, noise, and background. This just focuses on the image of a particular fruit, identifies
the fruit, and tells whether the fruit is fresh or rotten.



Algorithm:

Step 1: Input the fruit dataset image to check the fruit.
Step 2: Pre-process the original RGB image by thresholding it into a grayscale and binary image.
Step 3: Filter the image to remove noise.
Step 4: Subtract the background from the pre-processed image. 
Step 5: Perform edge detection and fill the defective parts.
Step 6: Calculate the area and quality ratio of the fruit image.
Step 7: Apply the condition and display the result.
